        <h1>About MurrayTAFE</h1>
        <p>Established in 1980, MurrayTAFE was the brainchild of a number of
          local educators, who recognised that access to post-secondary education was integral
          to the needs of the growing Murray community and regional industry.

              Free TAFE courses
              <br>
              <br>
              Get the skills you need without the Tuition fees!
              Any Australian citizen, Australian permanent resident or New Zealand citizen living in Victoria can now
              enrol in a Free TAFE course or government-subsidised training regardless of their prior skills and
              qualifications.

              Previous qualification: You can do your first Free TAFE course no matter what qualifications you already
              hold. This applies to all qualifications - whether they be through TAFE or university. This is because the
              'upskilling rule' has been removed.

              MurrayTAFE has expanded the Free TAFE courses in 2024 to include Certificate III in Commerical Cookery
              (SIT30821).
              Find out more about Free TAFE here.

              To enrol in our Certificate, Diploma, and Advanced Diploma programs, a minimum English language
              proficiency test result of 6.0 IELTS Academic or 50 PTE Academic (or equivalent) is required. However, we
              also offer Intensive English Language courses (ELICOS) to help students achieve the necessary language
              skills for their chosen career path.
              Additionally, some of our MurrayTAFE courses can be packaged with a Bachelor's degree program at a partner
              university. This means that students may earn university credits for completing recognised courses at
              MurrayTAFE.

              MurrayTAFE can give you the practical skills and knowledge you need for your career.

              An apprenticeship or traineeship is a partnership between you, your employer and MurrayTAFE.

              Your employer will provide you real workplace experience and teach you skills on-the-job while MurrayTAFE
              provides formal training.

              If you’re still at school you can undertake a school-based apprenticeship or traineeship while completing
              VCE or VCAL.

              Apprenticeship, Traineeship and Pre-Apprenticeship courses at MurrayTAFE are available across a range of
              industry and trade areas.
              An apprenticeship or traineeship gives you the chance to build transferable skills that attract employers,
              making you more job-ready.

              Apprenticeships and traineeships can commence at any time. Every apprentice and trainee must have a
              business willing to employ them and a Training Contract, which is organised through a local Australian
              Apprenticeship Support Network (AASN) provider.

              MurrayTAFE has great industry partners and access to some of the latest technology to teach into the
              future.
